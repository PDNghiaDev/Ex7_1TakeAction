* Modify the previous app at [Exercise 6.1](Exercise_6_1_New_Datasource.md)
    + Include `selftext` inside `RedditPost` model to get the post's content.
    + Fix parser to parse `selftext_html` from the API response.
* The UI should look like below:

* How to display post content:
    + If post contains `selftext_html` then display the content of `selftext_html`.
    + Else display the content of the post's `url`.
    + While the post's content is loading, should show a progress dialog like below:
    ![Loading dialog](images/ex7/loading_dialog.png)
* The post's title is displayed as title of the action bar.
* The post's author is displayed as subtitle of the action bar.
* Tapping on the back arrow should close the activity.
* Tapping on share icon should open a list of apps that can provide share function for the post's url.
